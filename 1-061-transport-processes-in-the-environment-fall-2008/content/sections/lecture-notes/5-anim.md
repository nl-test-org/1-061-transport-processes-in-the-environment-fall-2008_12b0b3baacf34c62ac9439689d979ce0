Advection and Diffusion of an Instantaneous Point Source

The following animation displays temporal records of concentration at three points after a mass is instantaneously released into a uniform flow. The concentration is Gaussian about the center of mass, which travels at a velocity U. The Peclet number of all measurement locations is high, so the maximum concentration is observed at roughly the advection time-scale.
