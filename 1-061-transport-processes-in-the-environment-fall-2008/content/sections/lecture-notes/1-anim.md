Random Walk Animation
---------------------

Diffusion animation.

This animation shows the motion of 500 particles in a one-dimensional random walk with step size X = 1 in time t = 1. This random walk animation mimics the effect of Fickian Diffusion. For some background and thought problems pertaining to this animation, review the theory (page 4) behind this conceptual model of diffusion.
